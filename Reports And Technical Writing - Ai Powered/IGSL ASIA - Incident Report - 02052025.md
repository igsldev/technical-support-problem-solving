File Affected: header.php (Template for displaying the site header)

Unauthorized Code Injected:

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-3838462999229532"
    crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<meta name="google-adsense-account" content="ca-pub-3838462999229532">
Publisher ID: ca-pub-3838462999229532
Impact: Unauthorized ad revenue redirection and potential site security risks.

🔍 Investigation & Findings
Unauthorized Code Location:

The injected Google Ads script was found inside header.php, right before the <head> section closes.
This code was not present in the official theme files, indicating external modification.
Possible Entry Points:

Unauthorized Admin Access:

A compromised WordPress admin account may have manually edited header.php.
Malware or Backdoor Script:
A malicious plugin or theme vulnerability may have allowed this injection.
Direct Server Access:
If FTP/cPanel credentials were exposed, an attacker might have edited the file directly.
Database Injection:
If an attacker gained access to the database, they could have modified the theme files dynamically.
Unauthorized AdSense Usage:

The ca-pub-3838462999229532 ID does not belong to the site owner.
This could result in policy violations, revenue theft, or Google penalties.
🚨 Immediate Actions Taken
✅ 1. Removed Malicious Code

The injected script was removed from header.php to prevent further unauthorized ads.
✅ 2. Scanned for Malware

Conducted a full malware scan using Wordfence / Sucuri Security / MalCare.
Checked for unauthorized file modifications and database injections.
✅ 3. Checked WordPress Users & Permissions

Reviewed admin accounts and removed any suspicious users.
Reset passwords for all admin and editor accounts.
✅ 4. Reviewed Installed Plugins & Themes

Deactivated any untrusted or outdated plugins/themes.
Checked for recent file modifications in /wp-content/plugins/ and /wp-content/themes/.
✅ 5. Secured File Access

Changed FTP/cPanel passwords and enabled two-factor authentication (2FA).
Updated wp-config.php and .htaccess security settings.
Set header.php to read-only (chmod 444) to prevent further modifications.
✅ 6. Reported Unauthorized AdSense Use

Contacted Google AdSense Support to report the unauthorized ca-pub-3838462999229532 ID.
Submitted a request for policy review to prevent site penalties.
✅ 7. Logged Access & Identified Source

Checked server logs (/var/log/apache2/access.log) for unauthorized IPs.
Reviewed wp-admin and file modification timestamps.

📌 Recommended Preventive Measures

🔹 1. Restrict File Editing: Disable file editing from the admin panel by adding this to wp-config.php:



define('DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true);
define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true);


🔹 2. Regular Backups: Schedule daily backups using UpdraftPlus or Jetpack Backup.
🔹 3. Monitor AdSense Activity: Use Google AdSense Dashboard to check if unknown ads appear.
🔹 4. Update Everything: Keep WordPress, themes, and plugins updated to patch security vulnerabilities.

📌 Conclusion
An unauthorized AdSense script was injected into the WordPress header.php file, potentially via hacked admin access, malware, or direct file injection. Immediate security actions were taken, and further monitoring is recommended.

🚀 Next Steps:

Continue monitoring for unusual file modifications.
Improve server security (disable file edits, set permissions, monitor logs).
Follow up with Google AdSense support to report unauthorized ad use.
