Technical Analysis of Desktop Fan and Power Supply Fluctuation

Date Reported: 2023-11-23
Date Resolved: 2023-11-23

Initial Observation:

Upon power on, the desktop fails to display anything, and the rear fan exhibits intermittent rotation, indicating a potential hardware malfunction.

Troubleshooting Steps:

Internal Inspection:
a. Open the desktop and check for loose connections and dust accumulation.
b. Remove and reseat all peripheral connections and perform thorough dust cleaning.

Power Supply Check:
a. Disconnect all power supply connections from the desktop components.
b. Power on the desktop with only the power supply connected to the motherboard.
c. If the power supply fan continues to spin consistently, the issue likely lies within the motherboard or other components.

Motherboard Inspection:
a. Reseat the RAM modules into different slots and perform additional dust cleaning.
b. Reconnect all internal cables and peripherals.

Resolution:

After completing these troubleshooting steps, the desktop successfully booted, and both fans maintained consistent rotation. The culprit was likely dust buildup causing intermittent connections and disruptions to the power flow.

Conclusion:

Regular dust cleaning and maintenance are crucial for ensuring optimal performance and preventing potential hardware malfunctions.
