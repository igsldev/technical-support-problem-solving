Date Reported: 2023–11–24 <br>
Date Resolved: 2023–11–24
<br>
<br>
Observed Issue:
<br>
<br>
Upon establishing a direct LAN Ethernet connection using a Type-C extension cable, the monitor displayed successfully, <br>
while other peripherals connected to the Type-C hub remained unresponsive. Internet and USB connectivity were unavailable.<br>
<br>
Solution:
<br>
<br>
After troubleshooting the connection, it was determined that the Type-C extension cable was the source of the issue. <br>
Replacing the extension cable with a Type-C hub adapter directly connected to the laptop resolved the connectivity problem, <br>
restoring functionality to all peripherals and network access.<br>

Recommendation:<br>

To ensure consistent and reliable connectivity, it is recommended to utilize a Type-C hub adapter directly connected to the laptop, <br>
bypassing the need for a Type-C extension cable. This approach eliminates the potential for compatibility issues and ensures optimal <br> performance for all connected devices.

Issue: Desktop Fan and Power Supply Cycling On and Off

Upon observation, the desktop exhibits a behavior where it fails to display anything when powered on. Additionally, the fan located at the back of the desktop starts spinning, then abruptly stops in a repetitive cycle.

To address this issue, I conducted an internal inspection. I opened the desktop case, examined all peripherals for potential loose connections, and performed a thorough cleaning to eliminate dust. Despite these efforts, the problem persisted. Both the power supply and the internal fan continued to exhibit a pattern of starting and stopping.

To isolate the issue, I systematically unplugged all power supply connections within the desktop. Surprisingly, the power supply functioned correctly when disconnected from the desktop. This led me to suspect a potential problem within the motherboard.

To troubleshoot further, I relocated the RAM to an alternative slot, conducted another round of dust cleaning, and reconnected all internal motherboard components. Following these steps, the fan began to spin continuously, and the power supply fan no longer experienced interruptions.

The root cause of the problem appears to be a potential short circuit induced by accumulated dust.
